As a highly skilled Blockchain Engineer, I possess extensive expertise in implementing, integrating, and deploying diverse blockchain applications, including NFT Marketplaces, Defi solutions, and crypto wallets. I have successfully developed noncustodial mobile wallets and integrated over 15 cryptocurrencies, including 10 ERC20 tokens.

My proficiency extends to writing Solidity contracts and deploying Defi apps and NFT marketplaces for various EVM chains. Additionally, I have contributed to the Osmosis blockchain, customizing liquidity mining processes. My experience also encompasses configuring, monitoring, and mining Bitcoins using AntMiner S9 and What's Miners with Slush Pool.

During my tenure as a Research and Development Engineer at Kerala Blockchain Academy, I have successfully developed and deployed enterprise blockchain solutions based on Hyperledger Fabric. I have trained over 300 students and professionals, including engineers from NPCI, in Hyperledger Fabric and conducted FDP programs for various organizations.

Furthermore, I possess hands-on experience in implementing and customizing Odoo and ERP applications for local and international SMEs. My proficiency in Python syntax is well-demonstrated through collaboration with global and intercultural teams. My diverse skillset and track record of successful projects make me a valuable asset to any blockchain-related endeavor.
